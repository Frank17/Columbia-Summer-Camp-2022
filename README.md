# Columba-Summer-Camp-2022
Here I saved the dataset and code I wrote for the final project for the Columbia pre-college program I attended from 8/1/22 to 8/5/22.

- **Course title**: [Big Data, Machine Learning, and their Real World Applications](https://precollege.sps.columbia.edu/highschool/online/courses/1-week/big-data-machine-learning-and-their-real-world-applications)

- **Note**: I'll do a major update on the code once I get some spare time. The current plan is to:
  - Organize the *existing code* by seperating them into different modules
  - Add a *new module* dedicated to cleaning the dataset via some EDA
  - Add a *new module* dedicated to regression-related algorithms
    - Will be somewhat similar to the current version of the `training.py` file

  - Add a *new module* for hypertuning modules and tolerance prediction
    - May not be available in the foreseeable future as I want to be as accurant as possible

- **With that being said, the current code is tested multiple times and is proven to be working just fine on the dataset. So if you're eager to give it a try, there's no need to wait for another update!**
