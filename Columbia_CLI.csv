The consolidation should be complete by the end of December.  I am consolidating them, not for payment reasons, but to increase my credit score with less installment accounts showing on my credit report.

To pay off an old loan with an unfavourably high APR of 24.99%. The payoff amount for this loan is $4,039 (as of 12/22/11, the date this loan would potentially fund).<br><br>2. For home repairs. My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems. It is also worth noting that I share my condo, so mortgage and bills are split, giving me a comfortable buffer in my disposable income to cover payments on this loan without any adverse affects.<br><br>Thank you in advance for your consideration!<br>",major_purchase,Loan Payoff and Home Improvement,112xx,NY,2.21,0,6-May,2,,,9,0,2217,18.8,13,f,0,0,15808.02,15808.02,14050,1758.02,0,0,0,13-Dec,5569.67,,13-Dec,0,,1,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!""",debt_consolidation,Consolidation,641xx,MO,4.96,0,Dec-95,3,,,6,0,10984,84.5,9,f,0,0,18462.04001,18426.58,13000,5462.04,0,0,0,15-Apr,5992.22,,16-Jan,0,,1,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
